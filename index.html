          <p>
            Women have always been known to have great intuition, especially
            when it comes to their body reacting to certain conditions -
            emotionally, mentally, or physically.
          </p>
          <p>
            These “feelings” tend to get “out of control” during specific phases
            of our life, the kind that we see in movies but have not explicitly
            discussed before it happens.
          </p>
          <p>
            We start to sense a shift in the way our body works; drastic mood
            swings with frequent tears or outbursts.
          </p>
          <p>The worst part?</p>
          <p>
            The way people start reacting to this outburst, responding like
            <i>they think we’re going crazy</i>. Honestly, we are not going
            crazy… It's just menopause!
          </p>
          <p>
            Menopause is a transitional period when our bodies start to wind
            down on our reproductive abilities.
          </p>

          <p>
            And it’s no fun ride. All the mood swings, hot flashes, night
            sweats, insomnia, joint pains, and the never-ending list of
            problems. Feels like we have a lot to deal with, by ourselves.
          </p>
          <p>But...</p>
          <p>
            Understanding and accepting these symptoms can help us<strong>
              simplify the process</strong
            >
            of solving them (as promised, as easy as 1, 2, 3)!
          </p>
          <p>Let us start with understanding the 3 stages of Menopause:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Perimenopause or Premenopause</li>
            <li>Menopause</li>
            <li>Postmenopause</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

      <h2>The 3 Stages of Menopause</h2>
      <div class="img-box">

          src="images/stages-of-the-menopause.jpg"
          alt="stages-of-the-menopause"
        />
      </div>

      <!-- topic-point 1 -->
      <section>
        <h3>Perimenopause</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            Perimenopause or Premenopause can begin
            <strong> several years before menopause</strong>. This could last
            between a few months to about 10 years. However, on average it lasts
            about 4 years.
          </p>
          <p>What happens?</p>
        </div>
        <!-- sub-point 1-->
        <h4>Ovaries start to gradually lower estrogen production.</h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            This is a natural process of growing older and usually starts around
            the age of 40. In some cases, it could start as early as when women
            are in their 30s.
          </p>
          <p>
            This could mean a reduction in our fertility rate, therefore, women
            looking to start a family should try and utilize every open
            opportunity with their partner!
          </p>
        </div>
        <!-- sub-point 2-->
        <h4>Changes in the menstrual/period cycle</h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            The horror stories begin with the change in duration of our
            menstrual cycle- there could be longer gaps between periods or
            spotting between 2 cycles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like, the frustration of not knowing when you will get your period
            next is not enough; the flow would differ too, making it heavier or
            lighter over time.
          </p>
        </div>
        <!-- sub-point 3 -->
        <h4>Intensified PMS (premenstrual syndrome)</h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            Drastic and frequent mood swings are the most common signals, along
            with increased insomnia or hot flashes.
          </p>
          <p>
            This could increase our irritability level, losing our energy
            levels; getting tired even after sitting at work the entire day or
            taking longer weekend naps to recover from our workweek would be
            common.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- topic-point 2 -->
      <section>
        <h3>Menopause</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            The official menopause stage begins 12 months after the last
            menstrual period (bleeding). What happens?
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- sub-point 1-->
        <h4>Ovaries stop releasing eggs.</h4>
        <div>
          <p>This means there would be minimal production of estrogen.</p>
          <p>
            At this stage, getting pregnant could be significantly harder.
            Hence, we notice the use of hormonal therapy or IVF for childbirth.
          </p>
          <p>
            We start feeling “low”, with the constant need to cuddle in bed and
            watch Netflix instead of going out and getting drinks with our
            girlfriends.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- sub-point 2-->
        <h4>Intensified hot flashes and night sweats.</h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            Waking up in the middle of the night, aggressively throwing our
            blanket away or turning your fan on max even though the aircon is on
            full blast.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our body starts to feel warm or hot suddenly, with flushed red skin
            and increased heart rate; followed by suddenly feeling cold.
          </p>
        </div>
        <!-- sub-point 3 -->
        <h4>Significant physical changes.</h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            The concept of “a minute on your lip, a lifetime on your hip” comes
            to reality. Eating one slice of cake for dinner could increase
            weight around our waist and abdominal region, with a reduction in
            our metabolic rate."
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also common to notice our hair and skin becoming drier and
            thinner; no amount of conditioner and lotion seem to absolutely
            solve this problem.

        <h3>Postmenopause</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            Yes, the troubles don’t end right at menopause. It is the stage
            where most of the severe menopausal symptoms decrease but it comes
            with additional side effects.
          </p>
          <p>What happens?</p>
        </div>

        <!-- sub-point 1-->
        <h4>Increase in Follicle Stimulating Hormones (FSH)</h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            This increases dramatically as our ovaries shut down and drastically
            lower the level of estrogen in our body.
          </p>
          <p>
            By this point, we started noticing a lowered energy level - sleeping
            in by 7/8 P.M. after work is a norm.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- sub-point 2-->
        <h4>Higher risk of certain health conditions.</h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            Some of the common health problems that occur during postmenopause
            are diabetes, joint pains, osteoporosis, cholesterol and heart
            disease.
          </p>
          <p>
            This could be an alarming phase, where every visit to the doctor is
            like drawing a lottery ticket- we need to maintain a healthy
            lifestyle to combat such possibilities.
          </p>
        </div>
        <!-- sub-point 3 -->
        <h4>Difficulty concentrating and memory lapses (often temporary)</h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            Forgetting your car keys, deadlines seem to increase over time.
            However, these are temporary symptoms of postmenopause.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

          We face a reduction in brain-derived neurotrophic factors which could

          Going through menopause by yourself is hard! Especially because it
          affects our daily life!
        </p>
        <p>
          Symptoms like reduction in metabolic rates and estrogen levels that
          cause weight gain and increase the size of our abdomen;night sweats
          and flashes, joint pains that make us feel 30 years older...are just
          to name a few.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, we have broken down understanding and solving menopause in
          3 easy steps; which can make this journey a little less frustrating!
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope you can see that menopause does not have to be difficult and
          solving it can be as easy as 1, 2, 3!
